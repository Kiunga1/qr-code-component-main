### What I learned

My major learning sections while working through this project are:
1. Applying rounded borders.
2. Selecting element by use of classes and Id's.
3. Selecting more than one element.
```css
img {
    
    border: 0;
    border-radius: 15px;
}
#qrCode {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding: 5px;
    height: 500px;
    width: 270px;
    max-width: 400px;
    border: 0;
    border-radius: 20px;
  }

 h1, .attribution {
    font-weight: 700;
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  }
```


### Continued development

Looking forward to learning more in the folowing areas:
-Responsive web development
-Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Acomplete guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with perfecting the layout of my project. I really liked how well summarized the concepts were. I will be using this tricks going forward.
- [CSS Rounded Corners](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand applying rounded corners to CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
